# listify

Create a basic page structure for the todo app with a header, main content area, and footer. 

The header should contain the app title "My Todo App".

The main content area should be empty for now, we will add the todo functionality there later.

The footer should contain a simple text like "Created by [Assistant Name]".

Use a clean and friendly design with a white background and some subtle colors.
